# Requirements Document for Codebase Knowledge Builder

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Codebase Knowledge Builder application, which is designed to analyze codebases and generate comprehensive documentation in the form of tutorials or Software Architecture Documents (SAD).

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Input Processing

- **FR1.1**: The system shall accept a GitHub repository URL as input.
- **FR1.2**: The system shall accept a local directory path as input.
- **FR1.3**: The system shall support filtering files based on include/exclude patterns.
- **FR1.4**: The system shall limit processing to files under a specified maximum size.

### 2.2 Codebase Analysis

- **FR2.1**: The system shall identify key abstractions (components, modules, concepts) in the codebase.
- **FR2.2**: The system shall analyze relationships between identified abstractions.
- **FR2.3**: The system shall determine a logical order for presenting the abstractions in documentation.

### 2.3 Documentation Generation

- **FR3.1**: The system shall generate tutorial-style documentation that explains the codebase in a beginner-friendly manner.
- **FR3.2**: The system shall generate Software Architecture Documents (SAD) that follow standard architectural documentation practices.
- **FR3.3**: The system shall include diagrams (using Mermaid syntax) to visualize relationships between components.
- **FR3.4**: The system shall generate documentation in Markdown format.
- **FR3.5**: The system shall support multiple languages for the generated documentation.

### 2.4 Output Management

- **FR4.1**: The system shall save generated documentation to a specified output directory.
- **FR4.2**: The system shall create an index file that provides an overview and links to all chapters.
- **FR4.3**: The system shall organize chapters in a logical sequence based on the analyzed relationships.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- **NFR1.1**: The system shall handle codebases with up to 1000 files.
- **NFR1.2**: The system shall complete the analysis and documentation generation within a reasonable time frame (dependent on codebase size and complexity).

### 3.2 Usability

- **NFR2.1**: The system shall provide clear command-line arguments and help information.
- **NFR2.2**: The system shall display progress information during processing.
- **NFR2.3**: The generated documentation shall be well-structured and easy to navigate.

### 3.3 Reliability

- **NFR3.1**: The system shall implement retry mechanisms for LLM calls to handle temporary failures.
- **NFR3.2**: The system shall gracefully handle errors in file processing and continue with the remaining files.

### 3.4 Extensibility

- **NFR4.1**: The system shall be designed with a modular architecture to allow for easy addition of new document types.
- **NFR4.2**: The system shall support configuration of LLM parameters for different processing steps.

### 3.5 Security

- **NFR5.1**: The system shall support the use of GitHub tokens for authentication when accessing private repositories.
- **NFR5.2**: The system shall not expose sensitive information in the generated documentation.

## 4. Constraints

- **C1**: The system relies on external LLM services for analysis and content generation.
- **C2**: The quality of the generated documentation depends on the quality and organization of the input codebase.
- **C3**: The system is designed to work with common programming languages and file formats; specialized or obscure languages may not be analyzed optimally.
